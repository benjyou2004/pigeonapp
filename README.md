# Pigeon Post üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: LifeX

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Benjamin Paul - MESCET Kunnukara

### Project Description
Pigeon Post is a revolutionary anti-instant messaging app built for the modern world's most pressing problem: things are too fast. We've replaced complex protocols with the timeless, unreliable, and charming technology of a single, overworked digital pigeon.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In our hyper-connected world, the joy of waiting has been lost. The anxiety of the "seen" tick, the pressure of the "typing..." bubble‚Äîit's a nightmare! We are robbed of the simple pleasure of wondering if our message ever even arrived.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Pigeon Post bravely reintroduces inefficiency to communication. Messages are sent via a digital pigeon with a realistic, useless delay. To further complicate things, we've integrated an AI poet (powered by the Gemini API) to turn your simple texts into unnecessarily flowery prose.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)
- **Frameworks:** None! This is pure, unadulterated vanilla JS.
- **Libraries:** `vis.js` (Wait, that was the other project. We used nothing here!)
- **Tools & APIs:**
  - **Firebase Firestore:** The mystical cloud-based nest where our pigeons rest between flights.
  - **Gemini API:** Our on-demand AI poet, summoned from the digital ether.
  - **VS Code:** The digital scroll on which this madness was inscribed.
  - **Git & GitHub:** The magical burlap sack and fortified tree for our code.

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   `git clone https://github.com/benjyou2004/pigeonapp.git`

2. Configure the pigeon's brain:
   - Create a free Firebase project and get your `firebaseConfig` object.
   - Paste your unique config into the `index.html` file.

# Run
Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No complex commands, no servers, no problems.

*The thrilling conclusion! A message successfully arrives in the inbox after its long and perilous journey.*

# Diagrams

*Our highly complex architecture: A user writes a message, an AI makes it fancy, it gets sent to the Firebase cloud nest, a pigeon grabs it, flies around for a bit, then drops it off on the other device. Simple.*

### Project Demo
# Video

*This video demonstrates the full, end-to-end user journey of sending a message from one device, embellishing it with the Gemini API, and watching it arrive on a second device after a glorious, useless delay.*
